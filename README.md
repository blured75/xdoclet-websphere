**Use XDoclet to generate correct tags for ejbs for WebSphere 5.1**

This project was done at the time when WebSphere was totally closed source. Don't know if somebody still use this version which is quite old.

Originally you NEED to have WSAD graphic tool to generate the delivery for a project which contains EJBs for WebSphere. There were no chance to automatize that. Hopefully XDoclet, an open source project, permited to automatize that for some j2ee server but provided a badly implemented tag generation due to the really closed format used by IBM.

So this release is an attempt which allowed me to work without this WSAD bloatware.

Due to the specifications finies au pipi, all the implementation of the 'j2ee servers' were not really compatible between them. Lot of core fonctionnality were let at the disposal of the server providers. They did worst than microsoft with java :)

Well done Sun & Ibm & Oracle !

It's a quite old project originally stored at sourceforge https://sourceforge.net/p/xdoclet-websphe

Have fun,

Blured.
